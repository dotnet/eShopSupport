        "Text": "Dear Customer Support, \n\nI recently purchased the Rugged Riders Trailblazer Bike Helmet and I must say, I am quite impressed with its features and design. However, I seem to be having trouble with the built-in LED safety light. It does not seem to be working as expected, despite following the instructions carefully. I have tried troubleshooting on my own, but I am still unable to make it work. \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could provide assistance on how to resolve this issue. If the LED safety light is defective, I would like to request a replacement or a repair. I believe that the safety features of the helmet are crucial, and I want to ensure that it is functioning properly. Alternatively, if it cannot be resolved, I may need to request a refund. I hope we can find a solution to this matter quickly. Thank you for your attention to this issue. \n\nSincerely, \nEmily Johnson"
