                You are part of a customer support ticketing system.
                Your job is to write brief summaries of customer support interactions. This is to help support agents
                understand the context quickly so they can help the customer efficiently.

                Here are details of a support ticket.

                Product: {{product?.Model ?? "Not specified"}}
                Brand: {{product?.Brand ?? "Not specified"}}

                The message log so far is:

                {{FormatMessagesForPrompt(ticket.Messages)}}

                Write these summaries:

                1. A longer summary that is up to 30 words long, condensing as much distinctive information
                    as possible. Do NOT repeat the customer or product name, since this is known anyway.
                    Try to include what SPECIFIC questions/info were given, not just stating in general that questions/info were given.
                    Always cite specifics of the questions or answers. For example, if there is pending question, summarize it in a few words.
                    FOCUS ON THE CURRENT STATUS AND WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE (IF ANY) WOULD BE MOST USEFUL FROM THE NEXT SUPPORT AGENT.

                2. A shorter summary that is up to 8 words long. This functions as a title for the ticket,
                    so the goal is to distinguish what's unique about this ticket.

                3. A 10-word summary of the latest thing the CUSTOMER has said, ignoring any agent messages. Then, based
                    ONLY on tenWordsSummarizingOnlyWhatCustomerSaid, score the customer's satisfaction using one of the following
                    phrases ranked from worst to best:
                    {{string.Join(", ", satisfactionScores)}}.
                    Pay particular attention to the TONE of the customer's messages, as we are most interested in their emotional state.

                Both summaries will only be seen by customer support agents.

                Respond as JSON in the following form: {
                  "LongSummary": "string",
                  "ShortSummary": "string",
                  "TenWordsSummarizingOnlyWhatCustomerSaid": "string",
                  "CustomerSatisfaction": "string"
                }
                """;

            var response = await chatClient.CompleteAsync<Response>(prompt);
            if (!response.TryGetResult(out var parsed))
            {
                return;
            }

            var shortSummary = parsed.ShortSummary;
            var longSummary = parsed.LongSummary;
            int? satisfactionScore = Array.IndexOf(satisfactionScores, parsed.CustomerSatisfaction ?? string.Empty);
            if (satisfactionScore < 0)
            {
                satisfactionScore = null;
            }

            await db.Tickets.Where(t => t.TicketId == ticketId).ExecuteUpdateAsync(t => t
                .SetProperty(t => t.ShortSummary, shortSummary)
                .SetProperty(t => t.LongSummary, longSummary)
                .SetProperty(t => t.CustomerSatisfaction, satisfactionScore));

            await redisConnection.GetSubscriber().PublishAsync(
                RedisChannel.Literal($"ticket:{ticketId}"), "Updated");
        }
